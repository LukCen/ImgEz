# ImgEZ - an image uploader built with Nuxt  

This is an image uploader tool, allowing you to upload an image to a server.  

It will allow you to generate a (one-use) download link, and, later on, log on, maintain your image gallery.  

Hosting is done using Vercel's Blob Storage.  

Maximum allowed size of image is 3MB - if you try uploading one larger, the tool will not let you, informing you of the limitation.  

TODO : find a way to set a timer to delete the image after 24hrs
